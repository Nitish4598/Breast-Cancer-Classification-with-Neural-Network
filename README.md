**Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Network**

This repository contains code for a breast cancer classification project using a neural network. The goal of this project is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on a set of input features.

**Dataset**

The breast cancer dataset used in this project is sourced from the [sklearn.datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) module in scikit-learn. It consists of samples with various features related to breast cancer tumors.
